Gordon
======

Gordon is a database management system for working with large audio
collections.  For the most part it is intended for research.  Gordon
includes a database backend, web server and python API.  Gordon will
automatically import music collections into the database and try to
resolve tracks, albums and artists to the MusicBrainz service.

Gordon is named after the character Rob Gordon from the Nick Hornby
book High Fidelity.  This was also a movie with John Cusack playing
Gordon (and Jack Black playing Barry, another great character).

Gordon is licensed under the GNU GPL. See the file COPYING for
details.

Please keep in mind that the database schema and API are still
evolving (a little bit), so don't be shocked if you upgrade and find
that things are a bit broken.  That said, this is being released to
let the broader community help build a more robust system, so please
contribute!

free LP (generously provided by Doug) to help you populate your
collection.

See the instructions in INSTALL to get started.


Basic usage
===========

Once everything is set up, and some songs have been added to the
database, a typical use case for Gordon would go something like this:

>>> import gordon
model.py: intialized external connection to gordon database on something.nyu.edu
gordon_db.py: using gordon directory /share/gordon
>>> tracks = gordon.Track.query.filter_by(artist='Charlie Parker')
>>> print 'Found %d tracks' % tracks.count()
Found 594 tracks
>>> tracks[0].title
u"7th April, 1951- They can't take That away from Me"
>>> print tracks[0]
<Track 1 7th April, 1951- They can't take That away from Me by Charlie Parker from At Birdland Volume 2 Disc 2>

Gordon makes it easy to grab the audio:

>>> x, fs, svals = tracks[0].audio()

Or even compute (and cache) features:

>>> chroma = tracks[0].features('chroma', bins_per_octave=12)

So running an experiment goes something like this:

>>> for track in tracks:
...     print "Messing around with %s" % track
...     x, fs, svals = track.audio()
...     # Run your favorite MIR algorithm on x...

You can construct queries on Tracks, Artists, or Albums.  See the
corresponding objects in gordon.db.model for details.

Queries are constructed using SQLAlchemy, so you might want to have a
look at its documentation (http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/) to learn
more.

See USAGE for even more detailed documentation.
