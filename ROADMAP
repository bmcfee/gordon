2 Late spring : MAY-JUNE                                                      OK v0.4

 * implement _annotation_ file association to tracks                          OK
   annotation types: (add track_annotation table)
  0 DB structure (create annotation table)                                    OK
  2 time-values (eg HTK .lab) files *check psql variable length coltypes      OK
  2.2 function to add arbitrary text files as annotations                     OK
  3 inter-relationships (eg covers) - create add_to_collection(tracks)        OK
  ? validate (enforce) non repeated annotations (sqla index)
  * improve tracklist format (see bitbucket issue #11)                       ...
  + support Annotations for Albums or Artists

 ? rename .py[co] files
 ? add flag to avoid copy full dir tree
 ? investigate why doesn't Py generate .pyc for FE modules run @ RT

 + test in apy25                                                             ...
 ? disable caching if no pytables/HDF5 installed (Win)
 * re-structure project code                                                 ... v1.0
