Cruft to clean up (in no particular order):

issued - Get rid of as many "from x import *" as possible, especially in the
   main gordon namespace (db/gordon_db.py)

 - Replace prints with logging

 - Remove specific references to mp3s and eyeD3 outside of gordon/io/mp3_eyeD3.py
DONE?   - ffmpeg can read way more audio formats
issued   - MEANS TO IMPORT META-DATA OF ALL AUDIO FORMATS, EVEN WAV/AIFF
   - eventually we will move away from eyeD3 to TagPy/TagLib (no Windows implementation?)
     to get support for metadata embedded in other file formats
 
 - Means to add synched *annotations* related to the audio

 - Clean up audio *features* extraction

 - Look again at the database. Specifically, what do we store in a Track? (there are some extra fields I think)
   and also how do we handle 
      : deletes of all tracks in an album 
      : tracks having no album
      : storing original path (right now it's relative to SITM_DEF_DIR)
      : zsecs versus secs (zsecs is the number of seconds with leading and trailing zeros removed);
        it makes more sense to either drop this completely or to store leading_zeros and trailing_zeros
	as well.  However it *is* useful because you can, e.g., limit your queries to tracks having at least 
        15sec of non-zero data. 
      : hashing a specific MP3 so as to not to import it twice. 

 - Write unit tests (!!) ... seriously?

issued - Fix bugs in audio_intake.py
issued - doesn't exit gracefully when it can't write tags, so the tracks
   are added to the database, but the mp3s are never copied

   - upload a windows installation guide (no web app)
   - upload a Gordon functionality map?
   - publish dependencies versions with which Gordon is known to work
     both linux and windows installations
