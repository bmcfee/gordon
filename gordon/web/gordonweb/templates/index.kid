Welcome to Gordon! Gordon is a database management system for working with large audio
collections. For the most part it is intended for research.  Gordon
includes a database backend, web server and python API.  Gordon will
automatically import music collections into the database and try to
resolve tracks, albums and artists to
the <a href="http://www.musicbrainz.org">MusicBrainz</a>
service. Douglas Eck wrote the original version of this pacakge.  Ron
Weiss was instrumental in transforming the original code into a
workable open source project.

Gordon is named after the character Rob Gordon from the Nick Hornby book High Fidelity. This
was also a movie with John Cusack playing Gordon (and Jack Black playing Barry, another great
character). Here are some Rob Gordon quotes from the movie (taken from the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146882/quotes">IMDB page for High Fidelity</a>:<p/>


<font face="courier">
Rob: Liking both Marvin Gaye and Art Garfunkel is like supporting both the Israelis and the Palestinians.<br/>
Laura: No, it's really not, Rob. You know why? Because Marvin Gaye and Art Garfunkel make pop records.<br/>
Rob: Made. Made. Marvin Gaye is dead. His father shot him.<br/>
<p/>

Dick: I guess it looks as if you're reorganizing your records. What is this though? Chronological?<br/>
Rob: No...<br/>
Dick: Not alphabetical...<br/>
Rob: Nope...<br/>
Dick: What?<br/>
Rob: Autobiographical.<br/>
Dick: No fucking way. <br/>
<p/>

Though to be fair, Jack Black's character Barry has what is probably the most famous quote:<p/>
<font face="courier">
Barry's Customer: Hi, do you have the song "I Just Called To Say I Love You?" It's for my daughter's birthday.<br/>
Barry: Yea we have it.<br/>
Barry's Customer: Great, Great, can I have it?<br/>
Barry: No, no, you can't.<br/>
Barry's Customer: Why not?<br/>
Barry: Well, it's sentimental tacky crap. Do we look like the kind of store that sells I Just Called to Say I Love You? Go to the mall.<br/>
