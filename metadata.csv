# Gordon CSV metadata file example - for audio-files in arbitrary paths using:
# audio_intake_from_csv.py (Specify this file's path to the script.)

# _General syntaxis_
# Python styled WHOLE-LINE comments are respected. White lines are ignored (e.g. below)
	 
# All exterior spaces are trimmed for every CS value.
# TODO: Escapable chars: \, (comma) and \\ (backslash, except in paths)
#  * NOTE: Excel will not display a line correcly if any \<comma> is used

 ,2,3,4,5,6 ... this line is skipped since there's no value before the fist comma
 
#
# _Headers_ are contained in the first uncommented, non-blank (valid) line.
#  It must include the first 6 in the order below shown, + any optional annotation headers

filepath, title, artist, album, tracknum, compilation,		HTK chords, HTK segments

#
# _Values_
#  TODO: * The escaped word \embedded is substituted with the corresponfing audiofile
#  tag if any (only works with certain headers including the first 5 (after
#  filepath). See audio_intake_from_csv._read_csv_tags doc)
#  TODO: * when not using \embedded, compilation is taken as False if its not '1' or
#  'true' (regardless of case) once trimmed
#  Optional values are stored as annotations. They're ignored if empty;
#  if path, read as txt files (path stored if binary, debug logged)
