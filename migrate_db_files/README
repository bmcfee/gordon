Gordon Database Migration Files
-------------------------------

These are SQL script added to the repository for development purposes. They are
meant to keep the database structure updated to reflect SQL Alcemy changes in
model.py and are used only when an older database structure exists.

* migrate .sql files prior to the date the build your database with the
gordon_initialize script should not be used.

About drop_all_tables.sql:
Use this file if you want to rebuild the entire database WITHOUT dropping the
database itself. It will use the correct table drop order. Run gordon_initialize
script afterwards to rebuild the db with the most current structure.
NOTE: all your data will be lost when you use this method. Try backing up the
data before and restoring it later, you might need to manually edit the data to
conform to a new structure eg if any columns have been dropped.
